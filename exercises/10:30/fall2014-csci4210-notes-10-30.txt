Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model

The ISO proposal for the standardization of
 various protocols in computer networks

A seven-layer protocol stack

 Application
 (Presentation)
 (Session)
 Transport  (TCP, UDP)
 Network    (IP)
 (Data Link)
 Physical

Each layer on the client side is logically
 communicating with the same layer on the
  server side

==========================================
SERVER TYPES:

(1) Iterative server -- server receives a
    connection or datagram/packet, handles
    that connection/datagram/request, then
    accepts the next one, etc. (single thread)

(2) fork()-based server -- a child process is
    created for each client connection (server.c)

(3) fork()-based server with pre-forked processes
    (e.g. Apache); with a dynamic number of child
    processes that changes based on traffic/demand

(4) thread-based server -- a child thread is
    created for each client connection (Homework #3)
    (MultiThreadServer.java)

(5) thread-based server with pre-generated threads
    (i.e. thread pool) (Homework #3?)

(6) A select-based server -- a single process
    that is able to poll multiple descriptors
    to check for activity (socket/file/pipe)
    -- no need for multiple processes or multiple
       threads!
